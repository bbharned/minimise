<p>Minimise USA starts by developing a clear understanding of our client’s needs and the specifications for improvements to design an energy efficiency program. We identify and engage all stakeholders in the process; preparing detailed reviews of our client’s existing facility information. Our project design and solution development includes analyzing financial, energy, environmental, and other necessary data. We then finalize project design, implementation and pricing parameters.</p>

<h2>Shared Savings Program</h2>

<p>​​​At <span style="font-weight:bold;">ZERO</span> cost to the client and positively no disruption to your business, Minimise USA will spare no expense to deploy its portfolio of state of the art energy efficiency technologies to achieve a maximum of savings.</p>

<p>​Minimise USA gets paid for a period (typically 5 years) out of a percentage of the savings generated by the application of the technologies.</p>

<p>Savings are determined by defining baseline energy usage pursuant to the <%= link_to "International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP)", asset_path("Core Concepts  EVO IPMVP 2014_Dec2014-3.pdf"), target: "_blank" %> that accounts for the variables not associated with the energy solutions we apply.</p>

<p>At no cost, Minimise USA would conduct a comprehensive energy survey and perform a complete energy conversion installing and utilizing a variety of Energy Efficiency Measures (EEM's) that include:</p>

<h5><%= link_to "Power Factor Optimization (PFO)", asset_path("mc60405.pdf"), target: "_blank" %></h5>
<br />
<p>Non-invasive technology that optimizes the power factor, to unity, on all inductive motors, that when measured correctly, by Minimise’ certified engineers, can produce significant savings, with no loss of performance while reducing energy costs and the wear and tear on those inductive motors.</p>

<h2>Solid State Lighting (SSL)</h2>

<p>We install the highest quality, most energy efficient, cooler burning, longer lasting and latest generation of lighting and, with every possible opportunity, we use made in the USA product!</p>

<p>According to the <%= link_to "US Department of Energy", asset_path("DOE_SSL_projections.pdf"), target: "_blank" %>, ​"over the 20-year analysis period, spanning 2010–2030, the cumulative energy savings is estimated to total approximately 2,700 terawatt-hours, representing approximately $250 billion at today’s energy prices. Assuming the electric power plant generating mix is held constant over the next two decades, these savings would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1,800 million metric tons of carbon."</p>

<h2>Service and Maintenance</h2>

<p>Our service and maintenance agreement will eliminate your maintenance expense during the initial 5 years.   You will have the option of extending the service agreement, which is designed to stay current with evolving energy efficiency technologies.</p>
