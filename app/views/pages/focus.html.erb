		<h2>Quick Service Restaurants</h2>
		<p>QSR's are faced with a variety of challenges they must overcome to be successful. Among them are having to do with:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>high employee turnover volume</li>
			<li>Mergers</li>
			<li>Food costs</li>
			<li>Keeping up with evolving and changing consumer demand for food choices</li>
		</ol>

		<p>As is the case for all cross sectors of business, QSRs must do all they can to: decrease cost, increase efficiencies, and transparently identify all areas of waste and redundancy as it relates to energy management. The Efficiency Measures along with the monitoring provides a transparency needed that empowers the managers to modify wasteful behaviors. These organizations benefit mightily from the Minimise SSP by increasing its operating margins, enjoying power company rebates, and the good will associated with reducing (and quantifying) greenhouse gases and the charitable gift that is directed to the charitable organization of its choice.</p>

		<h2>Medical Offices</h2>
		<p>Very few people are not aware of the economic challenges facing this sector, particularly over the past 2 to 3 years. Some of these challenges include:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Simply getting paid under the ACA system considering the penalties associated not participated in the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) in which many private insurers also participate.</li>
			<li>Avoiding Claim Denials which require the costly need for these medical practices to immerse themselves in every minute detail to submit a “clean” claim.</li>
			<li>Maintaining Certifications, as is the case with many industries, medical practitioners complain that the annual application fees alone are significant and that the test material often is not applicable to typical occurrences within their specialty.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Car Dealerships</h2>
		<p>Many may not be directly aware of this, but auto dealerships are facing a similar problem that has faced other brick and mortar retailers such as Border’s Books. Online advertizing and delivery of automobiles at worst has, lured away many of their prospective clientele, and at best, eaten significantly into their profit margins. Clearly, while many dealers wish to benefit from the efficiencies associated with the multi-technology components of the Minimise SSP, they typically lack:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The capital to effectuate this conversion.</li>
			<li>The expertise (they are an automobile dealership) of applying Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs)</li>
			<li>The technical expertise and experience of knowing how to MEASURE the conservation effect of the ECMs</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Minimise’s SSP proposes a simple economic solution that provides relief to the bottom line, and generates good will by</p>

		<ol>
			<li>going green</li>
			<li>quantifying and reducing greenhouse gases</li>
			<li>supporting charitable organizations. Lastly, the SSL (Solid State Lighting) lighting component of the Minimise SSP can create a lighting solution that can dramatically improve the staging element of the showroom and the outdoor show lots.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Manufacturing</h2>
		<p>Manufacturers in the US face a myriad of economic problems. To name a few, there are:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>supplier costs</li>
			<li>the challenge of attracting talent</li>
			<li>healthcare costs</li>
			<li>offshore competition</li>
			<li>rising fuel & therefore, delivery costs</li>
			<li>maintenance costs of plant, etc.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<p>All of these require a strict attention to the bottom line. Capital expenditures are usually reserved to equipment upgrades and adjustments to changes in product mix. In short, any manufacturer who aims to survive and thrive in a competitive and ever evolving business climate, simply must do all it can to adopt some aspect of the philosophy of waste reduction known as “lean manufacturing” popularized by the Toyota Corporation in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

		<p>Early exponents of this basic philosophy were found in Benjamin Franklin’s Poor Richard’s Almanac, wherein Frankin observed that “avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales: a penny saved is two pence clear…”</p>

		<p>Naturally, they all want the efficiencies associated with EEMs (Energy Efficiency Measures), but like many who are not in the energy business, lack the technical expertise to apply them, and appropriately measure the effectiveness of them for purpose of internally measuring their ROIs (return on investments). The Minimise SSP is the solution made simple for them. Once again, Minimise’s SSP proposes a simple economic solution that provides relief to the bottom line, and generates good will by 1) going green, 2) quantifying and reducing greenhouse gases, and 3) supporting charitable organizations.</p>

		<h2>Commercial Office Buildings</h2>

		<p>Like all sectors, commercial property owners face a variety of economic problems that range from</p>

		<ol>
			<li>rent competition from overbuilding</li>
			<li>Boom bust economic cycles that put pressure on their tenants</li>
			<li>costs associated with maintenance of aging infrastructure</li>
			<li>local demographic fluctuations (that are beyond the control the control of the owners) that could alter the properties’ relative competitive attractiveness thus possibly putting downward pressure on lease revenues.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Like with many sectors, property owners wish and need to benefit from the efficiencies resulting from Minimise’s SSP (2 of which are: an increase in the longevity of its energy equipment, and a complete outsourcing of the costs of maintenance therein to Minimise), but like all of the others not in the energy business, lack the technical expertise to apply and manage the ECMs, nor the ability to appropriately measure and quantify the effectiveness of them for purpose of internally measuring their ROIs (return on investments).</p>

		<p>The Minimise SSP is the solution made simple for them. Once again, Minimise’s SSP proposes a simple economic solution that provides relief to the bottom line, and generates good will by 1) going green, 2) quantifying and reducing greenhouse gases, and 3) supporting charitable organizations.</p>

		<h2>Local and State Governmental Agencies</h2>

		<p>The public sector is under constant pressure to manage and maintain an aging infrastructure, with limited funds. Improvements are virtually out of the question. The reduction in carbon emissions is virtually unattainable.</p>

		<h2>Public School Systems</h2>

		<p>Similar to Local and State Governmental Agencies, School Systems are under constant pressure to manage and maintain an aging infrastructure, with limited funds. There has been much research on the importance of delivering the desired lighting (lumens) to the desk top. New lighting technologies can deliver this through technology known as “light harvesting”. The result is the ability to deliver a constant level of lumens while reducing electrical demand. From a central location, all facilities can be monitored to achieve optimum performance standards for lighting, HVAC and water consumption.</p>
