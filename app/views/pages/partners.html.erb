		    	<h4>Ensight</h4>
		    	<p class="card-text">Ensight is an energy management design, implementation company that enters into long term partnerships to sustain energy cost savings for large corporations. Through its enterprise Energy Analyzer design software and its Energy Leadership Program Ensight has a platform to work with large corporates to achieve 20%+ energy cost savings profitably whilst supporting tight cash flows and challenging operating environments, Ensight delivers holistic energy design solutions with focused M&V saving with no-capital investment. Energy projects requiring capital are taken off balance sheet to leverage savings from the opportunity for projects that would normally stay undeveloped.</p>

		    	<h4>Partnership with Minimise</h4>
		    	<p class="card-text">Ensight provides Minimise USA with its energy design and financial strategy and M&V services in all the four solutions delivered at Hillsborough County Public Schools. From the design of the solution sets within each solution, to the creation of the digital platform and energy management digital modules that exploit the power of the Iot.Nxt Commander, Raptor and Ensicope technologies and software on legacy BMSs. Working at risk in the early stages of the project, Ensight ate its own dog food to support the creation of a successful project with Minimise USA.</p>
		    	<hr /> 
		    	<h4>Future as Minimise Partner</h4>
		    	<p class="card-text">Ensight's vision of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 100MT by 2032 will be accelerated through its partnership with Minimise USA. The digital energy management platform can be rolled out globally to transform energy use in the commercial and industrial sectors. The roll out exploits a weakness of the existing legacy BMS companies, in that they make money on rip and replace and Minimise USA makes money on minimise investment requirements and applying intelligence to basically dumb systems. This approach will allow mass replication and roll out of solution sets saving in the order of 25% in the commercial and industrial sectors.</p>

			      <h3>BEST</h3>
			      <hr />
			      <p class="card-text">In 2006 Troy founded BEST, along with three co-founders, and took on the role of Marketing Director. Troy was primarily responsible for creating the company’s new, transparent approach to energy management, which centered on the philosophy ‘you can’t manage, what you can’t measure’. In the process Troy secured a variety of technology partnerships to deliver a unique portfolio of energy saving solutions, which were successfully deployed in over 50 countries around the world. Clients included Coca-Cola, Crowne Plaza, DHL, FedEx, Ford, Harley Davidson, McDonalds, Sony & Subway.</p>

		    	<h4>Partnership with Minimise</h4>
		    	<p class="card-text">BEST’s partnership with Minimise is unique and is founded on a simple, old-fashioned but actually timeless principle; trust. Inspired by Minimise’s revolutionary business model and its visionary leader, Daniel Badran, BEST took a leap of faith and followed Minimise into unknown waters. That faith was rewarded in the shape of Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS), one of, if not the, most advanced energy saving projects BEST has ever engaged with. BEST technologies are now the foundation of that project, providing the essential energy information tools that Minimise needs to deliver on its promises to HCPS to save energy, verify project performance, reduce maintenance costs and engage with staff and students.</p>
		    	<hr />
		    	<h4>Future as Minimise Partner</h4>
		    	<p class="card-text">BEST’s mission is to become the world leader in the delivery of real-time energy management and control technologies for multi-site operators. Partnering with Minimise makes that mission eminently more achievable. What’s more, the partnership is already uncovering new, innovative ways to save energy, which is driving BEST to design and develop new, innovative technologies to maximise on these opportunities. The energy efficiency industry is ripe for disruption and the Minimise/BEST partnership, augmented by Minimise’s other extraordinary partners, is perfectly placed to spearhead the revolution.</p>
